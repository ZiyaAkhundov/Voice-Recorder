## Voice-Recorder

Creating an interval based on a predefined time with setinterval.<br>
When the time is up, we call the next function using the callback function.<br>
Audio recording is recorded with media stream and encoded base64 type.<br>
And finally it is added to localstorage.<br>
The user can stop the recording at any time, or the recording will stop automatically after being recorded for a predetermined period of time.<br>
