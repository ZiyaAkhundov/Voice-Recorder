## Voice-Recorder

Creating an interval based on a predefined time with setinterval.
When the time is up, we call the next function using the callback function.
Audio recording is recorded with media stream and encoded base64 type.
And finally it is added to localstorage.
The user can stop the recording at any time, or the recording will stop automatically after being recorded for a predetermined period of time.
